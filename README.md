## Local Installation (Personal Use)

Full local setup steps are documented in [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)
. Access to private packages and credentials is needed for local setup, but **you do not need this** to view the live demo or GIF previews.

## Why I Built This

I created **SkySong** with my _Filipino A Capella group_ in mind. The goal was to make it easier for members to:

- Follow along visually with the score as the music plays
- Isolate or mute parts to practice their own voice part
- Upload arrangements directly (via admin access)

This project allowed me to combine my passion for music and technology, while building something useful for real collaborators.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Support multiple organizations, so admins can share music with specific groups only
- [ ] Song categories for improved searching/filtering
- [ ] Edit and delete features for song entries
- [ ] Fully responsive mobile UI
